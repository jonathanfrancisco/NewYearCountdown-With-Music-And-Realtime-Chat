# NewYearCountdown-With-Music-And-Realtime-Chat 
Year-end challenge.

The year was ending in 24 hours and I didn't code for almost 3 weeks in december so, to come back I challenged my self to build this thing just before 2018 came in. I also made a similar like this one before (https://jonathanfrancisco.github.io/). It was also year end when I made it, 24 hours before 2017.

Everynow and then I will now make something related to new year's eve every year to challenge myself. This is the second one now.


P.S. The concept of the music when I started the project is where anyone can play a music through a youtube player maybe? and it sync with the server and all of the clients that is connected in the chat is hearing the same thing kinda like plug.dj
